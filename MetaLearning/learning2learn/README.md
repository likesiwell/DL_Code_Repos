# Learning-To-Learn: RNN-based Optimization 
TensorFlow implementation of [Learning to learn by gradient descent by gradient descent](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1606.04474v1.pdf). 
See the writeup for explanation of the paper [here](http://runopti.github.io/blog/2016/10/17/learningtolearn-1/)


I modified the sources code to fit tensorflow v1.2 and python 3.5
The result is proper.
But when we look deep into the trainOptimizer.py, the implementation of
RNN unroll steps maybe not in a correct way, I think, So, check it in the
future.
